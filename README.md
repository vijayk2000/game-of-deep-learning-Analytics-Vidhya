# game-of-deep-learning-Analytics-Vidhya
This was part of the hackathon organized by Analytics Vidhya.  Scored 0.858 in private leaderboard.  This is a good score considering that FastAI and ensembling was not use. I wanted to strengthen my knowledge of deep learning, hence used basic approach using Pytorch
